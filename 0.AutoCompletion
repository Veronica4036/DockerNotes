# Docker Command Line Tips: Interactive Help and Auto-completion

Docker's command-line interface offers powerful auto-completion features that can significantly enhance your productivity and accuracy when working with Docker commands. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it effectively:

## Using Auto-completion for Command Options

1. Start your Docker command:
   ```
   docker run -d --name app2
   ```

2. When you reach an option like `--pid`, type it and press Tab:
   ```
   controlplane $ docker run -d --name app2 --pid[TAB]
   --pid         --pids-limit  
   ```
   This shows you the available options starting with `--pid`.

3. If you choose `--pid` and press Tab again:
   ```
   controlplane $ docker run -d --name app2 --pid[TAB]
   container:  host        
   ```
   This displays the two main options for the `--pid` flag.

4. If you choose `container:` and press Tab:
   ```
   controlplane $ docker run -d --name app2 --pid container:[TAB]
   app1   app2   apps   sapp1  
   ```
   This shows a list of available container names you can connect to.

5. Complete your command by selecting a container and adding the image name:
   ```
   controlplane $ docker run -d --name app2 --pid container:sapp1 nginx

   ```

## Key Points to Remember

1. Double-tabbing after an option often reveals more specific choices.
2. The auto-completion can show you:
   - Available flag options (like `--pid` vs `--pids-limit`)
   - Specific choices for a flag (like `container:` or `host` for `--pid`)
   - Existing resources (like container names when using `--pid container:`)
3. Auto-completion helps prevent typos and syntax errors.
4. It can also remind you of available options you might have forgotten.

## Practical Tips

- Use Tab completion frequently to explore available options.
- If you're unsure about a command's syntax, start typing and use Tab to see what's available.
- Remember that auto-completion can show you container names, image names, and more, depending on the context.

By leveraging these auto-completion features, you can construct Docker commands more quickly and with fewer errors, even when dealing with complex options or when you're not entirely familiar with all available choices.
